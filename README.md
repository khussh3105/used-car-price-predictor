# 🚗 Used Car Price Predictor

An AI-powered web application that predicts the resale price of used cars based on key attributes such as brand, age, fuel type, and transmission. Built using **XGBoost** and **Streamlit**, supported by a robust, modular machine learning pipeline.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project offers a smart and practical solution for estimating the fair resale value of used cars, making use of historical data and modern machine learning techniques.

* Real-world data cleaned and processed from **CarDekho** datasets.
* Feature-engineered pipeline using **scikit-learn** transformers.
* XGBoost regressor model with tuned hyperparameters for performance.
* **Streamlit**-based interactive web UI for end-user predictions.

## ✅ Key Features

* **Interactive prediction**: Estimate car resale price based on:

  * Company
  * Model
  * Age (years old)
  * Kilometers driven
  * Fuel type
  * Transmission
  * Ownership status
* **Modular pipeline** for preprocessing and encoding
* Clean model inference pipeline using `xgb_model.pkl` and `encoder.pkl`
* Optimized for **speed, accuracy**, and **maintainability**
* **Streamlit UI** for user-friendly interaction and real-time predictions

## 🤔 Challenges Faced

* Cleaning and standardizing scraped real-world car data with inconsistencies
* Building a scalable, modular machine learning pipeline
* Avoiding overfitting while tuning XGBoost hyperparameters
* Designing a user interface that adapts dynamically to car brands and models

---

## ✨ Future Enhancements

* Add support for additional features such as car color, insurance status, and more detailed ownership history
* Enable real-time logging of user predictions for insights
* Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, Render) with versioned API endpoints
* Improve model performance with advanced ensemble methods
* Integrate SHAP or LIME for model explainability
* Add a contact form or feedback mechanism in the Streamlit UI
